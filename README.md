## Problem Statement

- Sentry does not provide direct integration with Mattermost.
- Mattermost webhooks do not support the payload format sent by Sentry.

## Solution Overview

This adapter serves as an intermediary service to solve the above issues:

1. The adapter receives an event from Sentry.
2. It converts the message to a format compatible with Mattermost.
3. It sends the formatted message to a specified Mattermost channel using a webhook.

## Technologies Used

- TypeScript
- Express
- Winston 
- Axios

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/adapter-mattermost-sentry.git
cd adapter-mattermost-sentry
npm install
```

## Usage

### Configuration

1. Set up environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```plaintext
   PORT=4045
   URL_WEBHOOK=https://mattermost.example.com/hooks/your-webhook-url
   ```
2. Adjust `PORT` and `URL_WEBHOOK` as necessary.

## Development

For local development:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the server using `nodemon` on the specified port in `./src/app.ts`.

## Production Deployment

1. Install `pm2` globally for process management:
   ```bash
   npm install pm2 -g
   ```
2. Start the application in production mode:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

To view running processes managed by `pm2`:

```bash
pm2 list
```

## Logging

Logs are stored in the `./logs` directory after the application starts.

- `all.log` - Contains all log messages.
- `error.log` - Contains only error messages.
